How much time do you have? If you are feeling the analysis paralysis - 
**don’t panic!** There are a lot of cool ways to use genomes to explore biology 
and build up ideas for new experimental designs. Some data types and data 
collections will lend themselves more to your study design. Take your time and 
start by moving from more descriptive analyses. What you discover here can help 
you come up with unique hypotheses to test.

Some common successful use cases and applications of microbial genomics include:  

- Outbreak analysis.
- Surveillance of marker genes (eg AMR or lineage markers).
- Identification of new species/unculturable species.
- Identification of co-infections from a metagenomic sample.
- Measuring strain prevalence over time.
- Predicting phenotypes of the microbe from the genotypes (eg resistance to drugs or metals).
- “Where was something similar to this previously collected?” is a question with a lot of practical follow-ons in public health and medicine.
