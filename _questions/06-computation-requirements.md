How computationally intensive do I expect my analysis to be?

How do I determine how computationally intensive my analysis will be?

How many samples/isolates are you working with? More samples require longer computation time and more power - more CPU cores may reduce overall (“wall”) time

What’s the average genome size for the organism of interest? Bigger genomes will require access to more RAM

Will you be classifying data against a database? Certain databases require high memory and storage

What kind of analysis are you performing? Phylogenetic analysis, for example, will require substantially more computer resources relative to sample characterization
