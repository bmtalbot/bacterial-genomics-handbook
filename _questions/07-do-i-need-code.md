Workflows exist for basic QC, assembly, and characterization for most microbial pathogens of clinical and public health relevance. Starting with a literature review of your organism of interest is a good way to identify the common resources available for analysis to ensure adoption of best practices rather than starting out from scratch. Standard approaches for phylogenetic analysis are also available in the open-source community; knowing which approach is best to employ for your organism of interest can also be identified through a thorough review of the available literature.
