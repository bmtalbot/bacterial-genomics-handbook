Comparison for contamination can start with the physical sample. Sequencing 
“blanks” of reagent without a sample (“negative control”)  can serve as a 
baseline of how much extra DNA you have floating around that could have 
been amplified instead of genetic material from your isolated sample. You 
can also examine qualities of the reads or assembly to see if they match 
expectations of what you know about your sample. It first helps to know 
information about what you expect to see. Do you assume you know what 
species is in your sample? Downstream considerations should be:    

- What percentage of your sample is not expected? 
- Are these “contaminant” species present in all your samples? 
- If you were to take the “contaminant” reads, would you be able to assemble the complete “contaminant” genome?
