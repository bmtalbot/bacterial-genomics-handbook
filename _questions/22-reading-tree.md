## Phylogenetic Trees

Trees tell us about the evolutionary history of organisms. It is useful for answering questions about when was the most recent common ancestor of two or more specimens in the tree, which members are most closely related, and when a particular heritable character that is shared across individuals emerged across each of their evolutionary history (convergence). Typically phylogenetic relationships are represented through a phylogenetic tree.

## Reading a Tree

Trees are composed of branches, nodes, leaves and a root.To read a tree we start from the tips of the trees and move to the root. The tips would be the present day, or the date at which a sample was taken. Leaves represent the sequences from the actual samples included in the tree. Leaves come off of branches, which vary in length based on the scales that sequences are being compared. Branches meet at nodes, which are representations of the most recent common ancestor for all branches and their leaves. As you move through the tree, nodes closer and closer to the root are further into evolutionary time.

## Evolutionary History

Phylogenetics trees are in and of themselves the best guess about the evolutionary history of a group of organisms. These trees use the idea of parsimony: the simplest explanation is the most likely explanation. To build a tree, you start with a set of traits from each individual you are trying to compare. This could be a list of phenotypes, genes, or entire chromosomes. Typically, the more traits you have, the more resolved your tree can be. Working with entire DNA sequences is very powerful because it gets you information about all of the traits that an individual has inherited, even if you haven’t yet identified the trait from that sequence. When we work with bacterial samples, we therefore typically work with whole genome sequences for our downstream analyses.

## Simplification

Trees are a simplification of biological history. It’s worth keeping in mind that many of the simplifying assumptions in tree-building defy observable reality. Evolutionary change is often not by single-base mutations. Individuals may acquire genetic material from other than their direct ancestor. The same mutation may occur in unrelated individuals.
