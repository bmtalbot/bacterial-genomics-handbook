- Many tools rely on publicly available data that might not have your organisms of interest. However, there may be 16S or gene data of your organisms available on databases like NCBI Nucleotide. 
- Though there might not be complete genome sequences for your organism, it might be helpful to compare your sequences against the blast nt database to see if any 16S or gene data links to your data. Compare the results and see if there are any sequences that align to the contigs in your assembly. 
- If BLAST yields no results, defer to general quality standards to assess the quality of your genome. For example:
- How many Ns are present in your genome?
- Are there any potential contaminants/host remnants/artifacts in your genome?
