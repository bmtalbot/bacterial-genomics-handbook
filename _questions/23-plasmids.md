Plasmids will be most relevant when leading an investigation regarding the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance elements. Not having fully closed or detected plasmids is expected when analyzing short read data. Use of long reads, e.g. ONT or PacBio, are generally recommended to better assemble plasmid genomes and more closely investigate the role of horizontal gene transfer in the spread of AMRs.
