## Whole-genome

Pro: Capture more information about sites of interest

Con: 

More diversity leads to less consistency in data

## Core-genome

Pro: 

More consistency even with more genomes

Con: Loss of information   

## Other considerations:

Choice of reference sequence

Aligning to specific genes/regions

Helpful for closely related genomes
