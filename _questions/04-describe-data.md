## Descriptive Analysis

Descriptive analysis can be useful for familiarizing yourself with data. These can be univariate type questions (How much do I have? What is the distribution of reads or genes in my sample). They can also assess for the presence or absence of information you might be interested in. 

### Taxonomy

Identifying/confirming the species or strains of each genome 
Example tool: Kraken2

### Abundances

Calculating the abundance of the species or strains of each genome 
Example tool: Bracken

### Diversity

Calculating the alpha and beta diversity
Example tool: QIIME2, vegan (R packages)

### Gene Families
Quantifying the presence or absence of genes or gene families (such as genes known to confer virulence or antibiotic resistance)
Example tool: AMRFinderPlus


## Database versioning

Some bioinformatic tools depend on having the most up to date version of a database that is externally created. However, many databases are still not versioned - itâ€™s a good idea to keep track of the time and date that you accessed the database. You will also want to be sure that the tool you are using accommodates a database with your organisms of interest.
