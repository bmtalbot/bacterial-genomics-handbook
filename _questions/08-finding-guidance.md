Bioinformatics is cross-cutting. Therefore, you might find a coach or mentor in 
a department near you that does work related to evolution, ecology, 
environmental health, microbiology, biostatistics, or genetics, for example. 

There is also a bright community of microbial bioinformaticians across the globe! Here are some possible options for finding help related to bioinformatics or computational questions: 
- Bioinformatics-focused slack channels: microbinfie (int), StaPH-B (USA)
- Code clinics or workshops at your university or center
- Coding communities including: Github, StackOverflow, Nf-core, The State Public Health Bioinformatics (StaPH-B) community, PG  
- Podcasts:
  - Micro binfie podcast Podcast Series - [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/micro-binfie-podcast/id1479852809)
