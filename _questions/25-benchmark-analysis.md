Benchmarks are a process of comparing the performance, quality, or efficiency of a system, tool, or process against a standard or established set of criteria, known as benchmarks. In bioinformatics, for example, it involves comparing a method (such as a pipeline, algorithm, or workflow) against a gold standard or commonly accepted tool to evaluate its accuracy, speed, resource usage, or other performance metrics. 

You should consider doing a benchmark analysis if you want to:
Validate your methods: Ensure that the tools or pipelines you're using meet industry standards or perform well compared to alternatives.
Optimize performance: Identify areas where your system or tool can be improved for efficiency or accuracy.
Ensure reproducibility: Confirm that your workflow produces reliable and consistent results across different datasets or conditions.
Support decision-making: Provide outputs that are meant to inform clinical or public health decisions
