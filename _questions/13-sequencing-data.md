## Publicly available:

- Common sources include Sequence Read Archive, GISAID, other NCBI, Japan and Europe?
- NCBI, ENA, and DDBJ are organized in a data-sharing organization called INSDC and synchronize submissions. Usually within a couple of days, any sequence available in one of these is available in all of them.

### Pros

- Readily available 
- Storage is external 
- SO MUCH OUT THERE!
- Speeds up your analysis
- Allows you to answer big, generalizable biological questions quickly
- Low cost (generally)

### Cons

- Might be missing or incorrect metadata
- Other people have access and may be conducting a similar study to you (scooping, but a nicer way of saying this?) 
- Donâ€™t always know the context around why things were sampled
- May have inaccurate dates or geographic information

## Primary samples

### Pros

- Control of the data 
- Better access to metadata

### Cons

- Expensive
- Requires your own sequencing resources (or need to organize how to get sequences )
- You will generally need to deposit your data in public databases (NCBI, GISAID) in order to publish on it, and this is often not trivial to do if your dataset is large and not well-organized
