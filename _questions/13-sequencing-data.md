Sequences can be from primary samples or from secondary sources.

## Primary Samples

Primary samples are the samples that you or a collaborator collect for a specific project.

### Pros

- You have the most control over the collected data 
- You have the best access to context around the data.
- Easier to make sequencing biochemistry the same and assess for batch effects
- Can plan to include or collect well-defined metadata from the start. 

### Cons

- Expensive.
- Requires your own sequencing resources (or need to organize how to get sequences).
- You will generally need to deposit your data in public databases (NCBI, GISAID) in order to publish on it, and this is often not trivial to do if your dataset is large and not well-organized.

## Secondary sources

Secondary sources are sources where the sample collection and sequencing was done elsewhere for a separate project or purpose. 

Popular sources of secondary sequences include publicly available databases such as:
- National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
- Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)
- European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)
- DNA Databank of Japan (DDBJ)

NCBI, ENA, and DDBJ are organized in a data-sharing organization called INSDC and synchronize submissions. Usually within a couple of days, any sequence available in one of these is available in all of them.

### Pros

- Sequencing files are already prepared for bioinformatic analysis.
- Storage can be external (ie already in a public database).
- You have access to potentially the entire scope of your species of interest.
- Allows you to answer big, generalizable biological questions quickly.
- Low cost compared to generating the sequences on your own.

### Cons

- Might be missing or incorrect metadata, such as dates or geographic information
- Questions you can answer may be limited to the completeness of the available metadata 
- Other people have access and may be conducting a similar study to you (scooping, but a nicer way of saying this?)
- Donâ€™t always know the context around why things were sampled.
