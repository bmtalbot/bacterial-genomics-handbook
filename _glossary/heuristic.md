Heuristics provide a way of estimating the output of a system, trading off
accuracy for computation speed. The terms originates from computer science,
where some problems may not have a computable solution, but a formulation
of the problem may give an approximate solution that can actually be 
computed. Heuristics are sometimes used to estimating the output of a system not fully understood or modeled. 

Most useful techniques in bioinformatics are heuristic; accuracy is traded for the ability to get results in reasonable time.
